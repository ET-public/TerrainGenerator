# TerrainGenerator
Was made using unity 2019.4.40f1.  
A working build with an exe file is in releases. Currently the code generates an island but it can be quickly changed to generate infinite terrain.  
Controls:  
shift - sprint  
escape - quit the project  
w,a,s,d - movement  
r - changes the map
